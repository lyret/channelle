## History

Sk채rmteatern is the creation of two swedish performence artists that, during the COVID pandemic started performing live theater online using Zoom meetings. To great success they were later granted a culture grant by the Swedish state to help continue this and develop an online application able to better serve as a theater scene and that would be free from the economic interessts of any huge international cooperation.
